With most other dating apps there is a multitude of fake profiles and scammers that you match with, on hinge that‚Äôs not the case! The difference between Hinge and most other apps is that it‚Äôs built for people looking for more than just a hookup, it‚Äôs a classier dating app. Compared to other apps you get limited likes (without paying ofc) but in all honesty it‚Äôs not a bad thing. It makes you more selective and it really calms you down so you don‚Äôt isolate yourself from the people around you to matchmake on an app for hours at a time. Also if you run out of likes and you see a profile you really like you can always send the profile to yourself by sharing it, or the profiles will rotate but you might not be able to see them again for a bit. I didn‚Äôt get a hit on my profile on the first day using Hinge but the next day I got three and I‚Äôm currently talking a lot to one of them. And guys, women will hit you up on this app too, other reviews are misleading. The woman I‚Äôm talking to actually commented and liked  me. Another thing about this app: it‚Äôs easy to use and it really focuses more on getting to know a person by its mixer questions on your profile. This app also looks clean and seamless, it‚Äôs by far one of the best dating apps on the App Store! Hopefully I won‚Äôt have to use it again but if I ever need to use a dating app again, Hinge is most definitely my number one choice.',\n",

That‚Äôs simply too much like Tinder/Facebook and doesn‚Äôt really provide anything meaningful for the app.  It definitely promotes the type of ‚Äúdrive-by‚Äù behavior that‚Äôs a scourge on Tinder.  Leaving a comment requires forethought about what to say, what kind of tone you want to convey, and engaging with another user‚Äôs profile.  You‚Äôre also much more likely to respond to folks who leave commentary, even if you don‚Äôt plan on going on a date, and that‚Äôs a very healthy approach compared to other apps.',\n",

Like others users have mentioned, I‚Äôm somewhat missing the value in paying for a preferred membership, because it only works if others have it, in my case women. Since you can only like a few people at a time and review your queue of matches in a limited manner as a free user, if you get a lot of hits on your profile you‚Äôre not going to contact them for a while. That being said, if a preferred member had priority in other‚Äôs match queue, it would add much more value. Additionally, the app should work towards making sure women actually respond to you once you‚Äôve made contact, because it‚Äôs another big issue. Finally, the number of people who were actually similar in my personality and in my league was dwindled so quickly that now it just feeds me whatever profiles it has lying around, and not even a week into the app I‚Äôm out of matchable women. As it stands right now, I certainly wouldn‚Äôt spend any money on this experience, but given work it could be a truly revolutionary app as it claims. Since I‚Äôm a young guy in a big market I would love to continue providing my feedback and working to improve the app if the developers are interested.',\n",

If you‚Äôre looking for a real relationship I think this is one of the best choices for dating apps.

It makes it easier to start a conversation by giving you the ability to like a specific picture or detail about a persons profile. You only get a few likes per day so you have to really choose wisely who gets your likes. This is good for those who are looking for a real connection but probably a downside for those looking for a hookup. I do wish you could get more likes but I guess that‚Äôs where the value in a premium membership is. So far I have not come across any bots or fake profiles either. As of now there‚Äôs no adds bothering you like on tinder. The messaging is lacking a bit. Its pretty basic. Just back and forth messaging No built in GIF or meme searches.

Systematically when a woman has responded to me personally, it has been after a week, or sometimes two! This isn‚Äôt once or twice though. This is every woman. And if I have asked them when they received my message? They had just received it in their queue. They have no way to tell how long a man has been waiting for a reply. It depends on how many other guys have left left comments to her before ‚Äúyou‚Äù.
